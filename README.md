Oh no! The construction job has gone awry, and the timelines have started splitting again. It's time to call in OXO to repair the damage before it's too late.

Technical theme: Turn-Based
Creative theme: Alternate Timeline


**RULES**

The timelines are collapsing into each other! You're OXO, and it's your job to keep your timeline mostly intact until your vehicle charges and finishes the job for you.

You lose if:
* 50% of the grid falls into the alternate timelines.
* You step into the alternate timelines.

You win if:
* You survive 25 turns without losing.
* You fix all the cells with timeline damage.

Your tools:
These are the tools at your disposal. You only have B action points every turn, so choose wisely!

* Move (1-5 AP): Move to the selected cell (no diagonals). Each cell costs 1 action point.
* Melee fix (2 AP): Fix all the cells adjacent to you (including diagonals).
* Ranged fix (1 AP): Fix a single cell of your choice.
* Bomb (1 AP): Leave a bomb on the selected cell. If the alternate timelines hit the bomb, its cell and all its adjacent cells get fixed (including diagonals).

How the alternate timelines work:
Every turn, the alternate timeline "heads" move to a new cell and consume it. Every 3 turns, each head splits into two. Watch out for exponential growth!

Hit Escape to quit.

Thanks for playing!
